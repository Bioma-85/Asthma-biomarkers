### Install Packages: 

BiocManager::install("affy") 
BiocManager::install("hgu133a.db") 
BiocManager::install("hgu133acdf")



### Calling Libraries:

library(affy)
library(hgu133a.db)
library(hgu133acdf)


### Set working Directory for normalization:

setwd("~/Desktop/asthma_research_file")   
      
# "asthma_research_file" is the name  of folder which contains ".CELL" raw file 


### Data Normalization:

f <-list.files(pattern = ".CEL")

# to look at the name of .CEL files in the folder
f                                               

# here we have 10 .CELL files, or (1:n), n is equal to number of .CELL files to be normalized

j = 0                            
i = 0

for (i=1, i<=j,j++ in 1:10)                      

{

 raw.data <- ReadAffy(verbose = FALSE, filenames = f[i], cdfname = "hgu133acdf")
 data.rma.norm = rma(raw.data)

}



# to get the expression estimates for each array
rma = exprs(data.rma.norm)

# to look at the result (first 2 rows and 2 columns)
rma[1:2, 1:2]


# Write RMA-normalized to file
write.table(rma, file = "rma.txt", quote = FALSE, sep = "\t")




### Annotation:

probes=row.names(rma)
 
ls("package:hgu133a.db")

Symbols = unlist(mget(probes, hgu133aSYMBOL, ifnotfound=NA))

Entrez_IDs = unlist(mget(probes, hgu133aENTREZID, ifnotfound=NA))

rma=cbind(probes,Symbols,Entrez_IDs,rma)

# Write annotated file
write.table(rma, file = "annotation.txt", quote = FALSE, sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE)
